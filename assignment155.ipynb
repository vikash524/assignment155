    "# Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "# An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications\n",
    "# to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# An example of API usage in real life is when you use a weather forecast application on your smartphone. The application\n",
    "# uses an API provided by a weather service to retrieve weather data (such as temperature, humidity, etc.) and display it\n",
    "# to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "# - Encapsulation: APIs hide the complexity of underlying systems and provide a simplified interface for interaction.\n",
    "# - Reusability: APIs allow developers to reuse code and functionality across different applications.\n",
    "# - Scalability: APIs enable distributed systems to scale by providing a standardized way for components to communicate.\n",
    "# - Flexibility: APIs can be used to integrate diverse systems and technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "# - Dependency: Applications relying on APIs are dependent on the stability and availability of the API provider.\n",
    "# - Security Concerns: Exposing APIs can introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly secured.\n",
    "# - Versioning Issues: Changes to the API may break compatibility with existing applications, requiring versioning and backward compatibility.\n",
    "# - Performance Overhead: Using APIs may introduce overhead in terms of network latency and processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Web API is an API that is accessed over the web using HTTP protocols. It enables interaction between different\n",
    "# software systems or components over a network. Web APIs are typically used for web services that expose functionality\n",
    "# or data to other systems over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Difference:\n",
    "# - API: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a broader term that encompasses any set of rules and protocols\n",
    "#   that allow software applications to communicate with each other. It can be used for various types of interactions,\n",
    "#   including local and remote communication.\n",
    "# - Web API: A Web API specifically refers to APIs that are accessed over the web using HTTP protocols. Web APIs are\n",
    "#   used for web services that expose functionality or data to other systems over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "# REST (Representational State Transfer) Architecture:\n",
    "# - REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications.\n",
    "# - It relies on stateless communication between client and server using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "# - RESTful APIs use URLs to represent resources, and data is typically exchanged in JSON or XML format.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Architecture:\n",
    "# - SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.\n",
    "# - It relies on XML for message format and can use different transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.).\n",
    "# - SOAP APIs define operations using WSDL (Web Services Description Language) and typically use XML for data exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "# - Complexity: SOAP messages are verbose and complex, which can increase overhead and make debugging difficult.\n",
    "# - Performance: SOAP involves more processing and parsing overhead compared to REST, leading to slower performance.\n",
    "# - Tight Coupling: SOAP APIs often result in tight coupling between client and server, making it harder to evolve and maintain systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "# REST:\n",
    "# - Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "# - Typically uses JSON or XML for data exchange.\n",
    "# - Stateless communication between client and server.\n",
    "# - URL-based resource identification.\n",
    "# - Lightweight and simple to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SOAP:\n",
    "# - Uses XML for message format.\n",
    "# - Can use different transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.).\n",
    "# - More complex and verbose messages.\n",
    "# - Often involves WSDL for service description.\n",
    "# - More suitable for enterprise-level applicatio\n"
